## 🔍 Introduction

This report aims to **alert the institution to a critical security vulnerability** identified within the ISTEC domain.

Using computers located in a classroom environment, it was possible to:

* Gain **administrator-level access**
* Escalate privileges to the **domain controller (server)**
* Obtain **full control over institutional systems**

⚠️ No sensitive data was accessed, modified, or exfiltrated during this assessment. The activity was conducted with **strict ethical responsibility**.

---

## 🚨 Identified Vulnerability

The ISTEC server manages:

* User authentication
* Shared folders
* Software distribution
* Access policies

A **critical vulnerability** was identified:

### ❌ Insecure Administrator Account

* Presence of a user named **`teste`**
* Assigned **administrator privileges**
* Extremely weak password: `teste`

This account was discoverable by enabling hidden folders on classroom computers, allowing unauthorized administrative access.

---

## 🧗 Privilege Escalation to the Server

### 1️⃣ Local Administrator Access

With valid credentials, local administrator privileges were obtained on classroom machines.

---

### 2️⃣ Server Discovery

Using the Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
ipconfig /all
```

This revealed:

* Router IP (discarded)
* DNS Server IP → suspected **Domain Controller**

---

### 3️⃣ Network Scanning

A scan was performed using **Nmap**:

```bash
nmap <server-ip>
```

#### 🚩 Suspicious Open Ports

* **Port 88** – Kerberos (Active Directory)
* **Port 5985** – WinRM over HTTP (unencrypted)

These confirmed the server identity.

---

### 4️⃣ Remote Server Access

Using **PowerShell**, remote access was attempted via WinRM:

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <server-ip> -Credential teste
```

✅ Result: Successful login as **Domain Administrator**

---

### 5️⃣ Full Server Control

Once inside the server:

* Firewall rules were modified
* Remote Desktop services were enabled
* Remote access tools (AnyDesk) were installed

This allowed **complete control of the server environment**.

---

## 💥 Impact Analysis

With full server access, an attacker could:

* Access all institutional computers
* View or steal confidential data
* Modify user permissions
* Deploy malware or ransomware
* Disrupt all institutional services

🚨 This represents a **critical security breach**.

---

## 🛠️ Mitigation & Solutions

### ✅ Immediate Actions Recommended

#### 🔐 Account Security

* Delete the **`teste`** account immediately
* Restrict administrator privileges strictly
* Enforce strong password policies

#### 🔑 Credential Management

* Never store passwords in shared folders
* Rotate administrator credentials regularly

#### 🔒 Secure Remote Access

* Disable **WinRM on port 5985 (HTTP)**
* Use **port 5986 (HTTPS)** if remote access is required
* Close unnecessary ports on the firewall

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

Unauthorized access to a domain controller is one of the **most severe security failures** an institution can face.

This report demonstrates:

* The real-world risks of poor credential management
* The importance of secure system configuration
* The technical and ethical competence of ISTEC cybersecurity students

The objective was solely to **improve institutional security**.
