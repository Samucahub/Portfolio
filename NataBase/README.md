## 🧠 Design Patterns

### 🎯 Facade Pattern — Report Delivery

The **Facade Pattern** was applied to simplify complex operations such as email report delivery.

Before:

* High complexity
* Multiple responsibilities
* Hard to maintain

After:

* `EmailReportFacade`
* Single entry point
* Clean, testable code

```kotlin
emailReportFacade.sendReport(file)
```

Other patterns applied:

* Facade
* Template Method
* Factory Method
* SOLID principles
